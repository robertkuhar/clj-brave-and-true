`(doc xxx)` is useful in a REPL to get the docs (p 51).  Another really useful resource is
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/apply which is the docstring along with examples!

### Leading Questions

* Then a clojure guy tells you to map over a collection, what's he saying? (p 49)
* Higher Order Functions. (p 49)
  * What are they?
  * Are they really unique to Lisp(s)?
    * What other languages have them?
    * Is this [common usage of Java Interfaces](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort(java.util.List,%20java.util.Comparator)) the moral equivalent of higher order functions in Java?
* What makes Macro Calls and Special Forms "special"?  (p 50)
* What are the 3 different ways to define a function?
* Destructuring.  Do you get it? (p54)
  * My "aha" moment is encapsulated in his quote "...bind names to values within a collection."
